Please put YeastMate configs and saved model weights here.

You can download the YeastMate model at https://osf.io/2xr4m/?view_only=True

Note that DEVICE in yeastmate.yaml must always be set to 'cpu' to avoid issues with incompatible GPUs when initializing the detection server.
This does not affect the actual CPU/GPU settings from commandline or GUI.
